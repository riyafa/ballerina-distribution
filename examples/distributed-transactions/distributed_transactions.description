// To improve the reliability of microservice-based applications, a series of
// microservice invocations can be bound into a single unit of work. The underlying
// mechanisms are that of infection and agreement protocols. This example demonstrates
// the Ballerina distributed transactions protocol in action.  <br/><br/>
// After starting the `initiator service` and the `participant service`, execute the `curl -v localhost:8080/init`
// cURL command to invoke the services. <br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module,
// see the [Transactions module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/lang.transaction/latest).
